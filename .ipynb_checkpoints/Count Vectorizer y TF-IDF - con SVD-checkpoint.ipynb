      "because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \n",
      "better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\n",
      "forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\n",
      "You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\n",

      "about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\n",
      "How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\n",
      "for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\n",
      "sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\n",
      "or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\n",
      "like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\n",
      "I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\n",
      "that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\n",
      "Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\n",

      "a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\n",
      "much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\n",
      "So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\n",
      "a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\n",
