      "\n",
      "[1]  What is JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism.\n",
      "JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the\n",
      "committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either\n",
      "full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\n",
      "It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\n",
      "drawings.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\n",
      "handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\n",
      "of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\n",
      "quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\n",
      "of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\n",
      "the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\n",
      "of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\n",
      "be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\n",
      "small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\n",
      "invisible to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\n",
      "adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\n",
      "off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\n",
      "files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\n",
      "archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\n",
      "aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\n",
      "can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[2]  Why use JPEG?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n",
      "24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\n",
      "networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n",
      "2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\n",
      "disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\n",
      "size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\n",
      "convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\n",
      "with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\n",
      "than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\n",
      "JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\n",
      "store or transmit an image more cheaply.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\n",
      "time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\n",
      "extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\n",
      "posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n",
      "(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\n",
      "only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\n",
      "to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\n",
      "black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\n",
      "in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\n",
      "people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\n",
      "more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\n",
      "GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\n",
      "things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\n",
      "gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\n",
      "similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\n",
      "hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n",
      "\n",
      "GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\n",
      "such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\n",
      "that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\n",
      "by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\n",
      "introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n",
      "(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\n",
      "should be avoided in JPEG files.)\n",
      "\n",
      "JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\n",
      "adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\n",
      "come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\n",
      "sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\n",
      "often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\n",
      "particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\n",
      "If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\n",
      "scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\n",
      "subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\n",
      "The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\n",
      "You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\n",
      "images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\n",
      "of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\n",
      "should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n",
      "(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\n",
      "applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\n",
      "a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\n",
      "can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\n",
      "converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\n",
      "If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\n",
      "prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\n",

      "selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\n",
      "the meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\n",

      "\n",
      "The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n",
      "(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\n",
      "the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\n",
      "observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\n",

      "typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\n",

      "If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\n",
      "go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\n",
      "might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\n",
      "The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\n",
      "The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n",
